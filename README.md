These are my NixOS Configuration Files that I use daily on my current machines.
I have been messing with NixOS, Home Manager, and Flakes since Fall of 2023. 
Below I will include the different hosts that I have inside this configuration.
As well as any specifics That might be useful for someone looking at my setup.
Feel free to copy or adjust any of my dot files, I can't promise it will work but 
I wish you the best of luck.
